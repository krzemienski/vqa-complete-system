- **`test_download_single.py`**: Test script for single video
  - Successfully downloaded test video
  - Verified download functionality works

#### 2. Created Degradation Scripts
- **`create_degraded_videos.py`**: Comprehensive degradation script
  - 7 categories of degradations
  - 18 different degradation types
  - Compression, noise, blur, scaling, temporal, color, combined
  - Metadata tracking

- **`test_degradation_single.py`**: Test degradation script
  - Successfully created degraded video
  - Verified ffmpeg integration works
  - 68.3% compression achieved in test

#### 3. Documentation Created
- **`test_videos/README.md`**: Complete documentation
  - Directory structure explanation
  - Usage instructions
  - Expected quality scores
  - Testing guidelines

#### 4. Verified Prerequisites
- âœ… ffmpeg installed and working (version 7.1.1)
- âœ… Directory structure created
- âœ… Scripts are executable
- âœ… Test download successful
- âœ… Test degradation successful

### Next Steps to Complete TODO 2:

#### 1. Download All Test Videos
```bash
cd scripts
python download_test_videos.py
```

This will download approximately:
- 7 original videos
- Total size: ~500MB-1GB
- Time: 5-15 minutes depending on connection

#### 2. Create All Degraded Versions
```bash
cd scripts
python create_degraded_videos.py
```

This will create:
- 126 degraded videos (7 original Ã— 18 degradations)
- Total size: ~2-3GB
- Time: 20-40 minutes depending on CPU

### Current Test Results:
- Downloaded: `test_blazes.mp4` (2.38 MB)
- Created: `test_blazes_crf40.mp4` (0.76 MB, 68.3% compression)
- Both scripts tested and functional

### Directory Structure Ready:
```
test_videos/
â”œâ”€â”€ original/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_blazes.mp4  âœ… (test video downloaded)
â””â”€â”€ degraded/
    â””â”€â”€ compression/
        â””â”€â”€ test_blazes_crf40.mp4  âœ… (test degradation created)
```

### Estimated Time to Complete TODO 2:
- Full download: 5-15 minutes
- Full degradation: 20-40 minutes
- Total: 25-55 minutes

### Quality Assurance:
- Test downloads verified âœ…
- Test degradations verified âœ…
- ffmpeg compatibility confirmed âœ…
- Scripts ready for full execution âœ…

## Recommendation:
The scripts are tested and ready. When ready to proceed with full download and degradation:
1. Ensure sufficient disk space (~4GB)
2. Run `download_test_videos.py`
3. Run `create_degraded_videos.py`
4. Verify with `degradation_metadata.json`

TODO 2 can be marked complete after running both scripts successfully.
